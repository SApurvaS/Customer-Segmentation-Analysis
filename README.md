# Quantium_Virtual_Internship

## Background
Quantium has had a data partnership with a large supermarket brand for the last few years who provide transactional and customer data. You are an analyst within the Quantium analytics team and are responsible for delivering highly valued data analytics and insights to help the business make strategic decisions.

You are part of Quantium’s retail analytics team and have been approached by your client, the Category Manager for Chips, who wants to better understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behaviour within the region.
The insights from your analysis will feed into the supermarket’s strategic plan for the chip category in the next half year.

1) Examine transaction data – look for inconsistencies, missing data across the data set, outliers, correctly identified category items, numeric data across all tables. If you determine any anomalies make the necessary changes in the dataset and save it. Having clean data will help when it comes to your analysis. 

2) Examine customer data – check for similar issues in the customer data, look for nulls and when you are happy merge the transaction and customer data together so it’s ready for the analysis ensuring you save your files along the way.

3) Data analysis and customer segments – in your analysis make sure you define the metrics – look at total sales, drivers of sales, where the highest sales are coming from etc. Explore the data, create charts and graphs as well as noting any interesting trends and/or insights you find. These will all form part of our report to Julia. 

4) Deep dive into customer segments – define your recommendation from your insights, determine which segments we should be targeting, if packet sizes are relative and form an overall conclusion based on your analysis. 

## Tasks performed
As an analyst within the retail analytics team, I was responsible for delivering valuable data insights to help the business make strategic decisions.

In this project, I worked with a large supermarket brand's transactional and customer data to better understand the types of customers who purchase chips and their purchasing behavior within the region. My analysis included examining transaction data for inconsistencies, missing data, outliers, and correctly identified category items. Additionally, I checked for similar issues in the customer data, merged the transaction and customer data, and defined metrics to explore the data and create charts and graphs.

I also performed a deep dive into customer segments to define recommendations and determine which segments to target based on their purchasing behavior and pack size preferences. Through this project, I derived extra features such as 'pack size' and 'brand' name from the data and defined metrics of interest to enable me to draw insights on who spends on chips and what drives spend for each customer segment.
